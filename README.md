# A CPHQ 4U
I am a healthcare quality professional looking to expand my skills in data and data analytics. 
I am currently working on my Masters in Healthcare Administration. I joined GitHub to learn more about the back end of data management.
A project I would like to collaborate on would be a user friendly database for all healthcare performance measures with thresholds for achievement. It would be great if this product could auto-update based on legislation or recent updates to best practices.
